## Aim of experiment
The objective of the C-V characterization of PMOS capacitors simulated experiment is to analyze electrical properties such as threshold voltage, oxide thickness, and doping concentration by virtually sweeping the applied voltage and studying capacitance behavior across different operating modes.
